~~ PAL Users ~~
The "root" folder that was downloaded defaults the game to NTSC mode. The files in the "root replacements" folder can be used to default the Hack Pack to PAL Mode (the same effect as executing the Debug Menu-->Character Select Screen Codes-->Toggle PAL/NTSC Mode).

Overwrite the following files/folder then build the ISO:
/root/MnSlChr.0sd
/root/MnSlChr.1sd
/root/&&systemdata/
